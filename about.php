  <strong>Our Mission</strong><br />
  The aim of Longwood Robotics is to establish and carry out a  school-based program that is dedicated to the overall enhancement of  knowledge. As students, we work together to further our knowledge and  expertise in the areas science, math, technology, engineering and  computer-based applications. In addition, we work to better our  abilities in a group setting and promote community unity. Through the  conglomerated efforts of our team’s participants, mentors and advisors,  we hope to create an overall benevolent, educational experience for  both those involved and those affected. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Our Community</strong><br />
  As aforementioned in our mission statement, community unity is a primary objective of Team #564. The salient efforts of our team have been targeted towards the  younger generations. Lego League is yet another program instituted by  FIRST®. Team #564 has aided Lego League in various ways, ranging from  help with web design to volunteering as hosts at regional competitions.  As a team, we are proud to support these students who are not only the  future of Robotics but also the technological taskforce that follows us. <br />

  <strong>Our Goals</strong><br />
  The goals of our Robotics team vary from year to year, but this  year in particular has already displayed its tremendous opportunity and  potential. As always, our team shall contribute beyond their maximum  and put forth our best efforts in designing, building, configuring the  robot, ultimately competing with the aspirations of going on to  national competition. Teamwork is one of the most emphasized aspects of  the Robotics program. It is through the utilization of teamwork that we  have ever and will ever accomplish. 
  Outside of preforming to our maximum potential in competition, our  team would like to be viewed as the paradigm of gracious  professionalism and one that, when in error, accepts, corrects and  learns from that error. If this can be attained, one major goal of our  program will have been fulfilled. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>The Commitment</strong><br />
  The participants of our Robotics Program endure countless hours of  hard work. In the beginning of the school year, they attend meetings  once a week that typically last approximately three hours. These  meetings continue up until the FIRST kickoff early in January when the  objective and tasks of the competition are revealed. Subsequently and  throughout the six-week bulid season, the members attend the program  for a minimum of three hours after school every day, approximately  twelve hours on Saturdays, with the exception of Sundays (yet even  those are occasionally used as for meetings). This program without a  doubt is comprised of students who are truly dedicated to their  commitments, these &quot;core&quot; members often distinguished early on in the  season. It is typical for the entire program to consume over 250 hours  of a participant's time, and every member that participates on the team  deserves a great amount of commendation for their efforts.<br />
